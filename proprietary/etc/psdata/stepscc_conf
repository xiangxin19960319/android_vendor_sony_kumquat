# Set the aol_mode TRUE as default and only through

# The relation between the PP flag and the aol_mode is
# that the PP flag enables host side (=aol_mode)
# to set the FOR bit for GMM attach/RAU when sending ISI message
# GPDS_AOL_CTX_ACTIVE/GPDS_AOL_CTX_HPLMN_ACTIVE/GPDS_AOL_CTX_VPLMN_ACTIVE.
# If PP flag is disabled then request from host side will be ignored.
